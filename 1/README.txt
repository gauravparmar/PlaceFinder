The PlaceFinder web service allows you to convert street addresses 
("like 14 gabroveni, bucuresti") or 
place names (like "stirbei voda") into geographic coordinates 
(like latitude 38.898717, longitude -77.035974) that you can use
as the center of a map or the position for a map marker. This conversion is
called "geocoding" and can be used to make your application location-aware.

This service also allows you to convert geographic coordinates into street addresses or place names.
this conversion is called "reverse geocoding" and can be used to provide user 
feedback when only coordinates are known.
